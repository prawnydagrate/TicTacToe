# toetactic_lib

`toetactic_lib` is a library that provides functionality as an engine that plays Tic Tac Toe optimally, on any square grid larger than 2x2 (theoretically).

## Background

**2024.12.06**:

I'd been exploring various algorithms in computer science, and it didn't take long for me to realize that I love learning about these algorithms and understanding them.

Therefore, I decided to put my skills to the test by writing an 'engine' that plays Tic Tac Toe optimally. Now, of course, normal Tic Tac Toe would be too simple. In fact, I myself never lose at Tic Tac Toe. So, I wanted to write my 'engine' such that I can always expand it to larger grids like 5x5. I have a strong feeling that I would suck at 5x5 Tic Tac Toe.
