# Tic Tac Toe

**2024.12.06**  
I've been exploring famous algorithms in computer science, like:

- Depth first search,
- Breadth first search,
- Dijkstra's algorithm,
- A\*,
- and Minimax

  It didn't take long for me to realize that I love learning about these algorithms and understanding them. I'm gonna put my skills to the test by writing an 'engine' that plays Tic Tac Toe optimally. Now, of course, normal Tic Tac Toe would be too simple. In fact, I myself never lose at Tic Tac Toe. I'm gonna write my 'engine' such that I can always expand it to larger grids like 5x5. I would SUCK at 5x5 Tic Tac Toe.
