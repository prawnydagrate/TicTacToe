# Tic Tac Toe

**2024.12.06**:  
&emsp;I've been exploring various algorithms in computer science, and it didn't take long for me to realize that I love learning about these algorithms and understanding them.  
&emsp;I'm gonna put my skills to the test by writing an 'engine' that plays Tic Tac Toe optimally. Now, of course, normal Tic Tac Toe would be too simple. In fact, I myself never lose at Tic Tac Toe. I'm gonna write my 'engine' such that I can always expand it to larger grids like 5x5. I would SUCK at 5x5 Tic Tac Toe.
